                is the result of years of studies on <i>music plagiarism</i> and <i>music similarities fields</i>,
                conducted by researchers and students within the <a href="http://music.di.unisa.it/">Musimathics Lab</a> of the University of Salerno,
                coordinated by prof. <a href="https://docenti.unisa.it/003550/home"> Roberto De Prisco</a>.

                <i>Plagiarism</i>, i.e., the act of copying the work of others and trying to pass it off as one own is seen as a legal offense.
                In the Internet era, the fast, vast, and easy access of information has further escalated
                the problem of plagiarism. Plagiarism occurs when two works are “substantially similar”, whereas the owner of one of the two works has copied or
                has been inspired by the work of another. Interpreting or measuring the concept of substantially similarity is actually an open issue.

                According to the legislation, there are no general and accepted rules according to which a minimum number of notes,
                or beats, simultaneously present in two music compositions constitutes plagiarism. Over the years has emerged
                the need of defining the general criteria to identify cases of plagiarism. Even not emphasized in the law, <i>melody</i>
                usually is the deciding element in cases of plagiarism. In fact, often we talk about <i>melodic plagiarism</i> to indicate music plagiarism.
                It is a phenomenon very debated in the music context, particularly in the context of western <i>pop music</i>.

                The recognition of a music plagiarism is not a trivial task, because it depends by
                the ability of recognizing similarities between melodic fragments inside two melodies.
                We have proposed both text-based and fuzzy-based plagiarism detection tools.
                <b>Plagiarism Detection</b> platform embeds a metric of similarity that uses <i>text similarity</i> and
                <i>clustering techniques</i>
